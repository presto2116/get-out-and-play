#Get Out and Play!

##By: Preston Straight
### Idea
Create outdoor activities such as soccer games, ultimate frisbee, and other sports. select a date and open it up to registration. If you get enought people to commit, then the activity is held. Easy way to throw out ideas and see if others are interested. Example: its Monday morning and it is pouring rain. All I want to do is play some ultimate frisbee outside and I see the weather is great on saturday. I will create an activity. Activity: Ultimate frisbee, location : Silver Spring park. Date Saturday May 9. Time: 1 to 2 pm. Then open it to the community. If enough are interested, then the creator can send email to interested parties and the event is held. If no interest, try again next week...

###User Stories:

3. If enough people attend an activity. All users will be emailed the event and expected to attend.(maybe a monetary down payment to prevent no-shows)
4. A user can comment on activities to ask/answer questions and clarify the event.
